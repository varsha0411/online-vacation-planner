    <div>
      <h25>ANAIMALAI HILLS</h25>
      
      <h27>The Anaimalais or Anamala, also known as the Elephant Mountains, are a range of mountains in the southern Western Ghats and span the border of western Tamil Nadu(Coimbatore district and Tiruppur district) and central Kerala(Palakkad district, Thrissur district, Ernakulam district, and Idukki district) in Southern India. The name anamala is derived from the Tamil word aanai, the Malayalam word aana, meaning elephant, or from tribal languages. Mala or Malai means 'hill', and thus 'Elephant hill'</h27>
      <h26>FOOD</h26>
      <h28>SAMBAR</h28>
      <h29> It is a lentil-based stew which has been prepared with tomatoes and/or tamarind as its base for building flavours. Whether it is for breakfast or a lavish traditional Tamilian lunch spread, Sambar is a significant part of almost every meal in Tamil Nadu and in Tamilian homes everywhere. Vegetables such as carrots, yam, drumsticks and okra are added to the pot of Sambar to make it more delicious and nutritious.</h29>
      <h30>UTTAPAM</h30>
      <h31>Uttapam is a dish very similar to the dosa and is a speciality of Tamil Nadu food. It is made by grinding the Urad Dal and rice powder together. It is then allowed to ferment for a few hours and then slow fried over very minimal oil over a skillet. Uttapam is flat and crispy at the sides just like dosa but soft and doughy in the middle like an Idli. The uttapam is then given a little topping of tomatoes, onions, capsicum etc. It tastes delicious with either coconut chutney or Sambar, however, I would recommend the coconut chutney. You can also try it with the spicy tomato and chilli chutney which tastes quite heavenly.</h31>
